The main function creates an executor for running tasks and a spawner for creating new tasks. It then spawns an asynchronous task to print ClarenceGrady's computer: howdy!”, wait for 2 seconds, and print “ClarenceGrady's computer: done!”. However, this task doesn’t block the main function, which continues to print “ClarenceGrady's computer: hey hey” before the asynchronous task has a chance to run. Once all tasks are spawned and the spawner is dropped, the executor runs until all tasks are complete, allowing the asynchronous task to execute. Therefore, “ClarenceGrady's computer: hey hey” is printed before “ClarenceGrady's computer: howdy!” and “ClarenceGrady's computer: done!” because the main function doesn’t wait for the asynchronous task to complete.
